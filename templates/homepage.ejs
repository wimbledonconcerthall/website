          <p>Caption: In search of a new concert hall for London in Wimbledon.</p>
          <p>Narrator: "Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything" — Plato</p>
          <p>Darcey Bussell: Hello, my name is Darcey Bussell and I'm an artistic patron of the Wimbledon Concert Hall project. The great concert halls of the world have the power to change lives and inspire. To leave a strong intergenerational legacy. London has a great need for a world-class hall, and Wimbledon can offer the perfect site.</p>
          <p>Narrator: Frank Gehry is the architect whose flights of imagination have given wings and soul to music itself.</p>
          <p>Frank Gehry: Finally I've pushed the two concert halls together, and it seems they come alive.</p>
          <p>Narrator: He is the master designer of some of the world's most exceptional halls. We have come to see Frank Gehry to begin work on a new concert hall for London in Wimbledon.</p>
          <p>Frank Gehry: Concert hall projects are the most exciting for me and I prioritize them over living practically. I love doing them, because I love the culture and I love the people. I love the music. I love the challenge of it. I think, if you make a proper room for music that people wanna go to, they are gonna come from everywhere. If there many of those places. </p>
          <p>Esa Pekka Salonen: Having Frank Ghery doing a concert hall in Wimbledon would be a total transformation of London concert life. It would have a global effect. So, these buildings, the influence goes way beyond the art-form itself.</p>

    <h3>Imagine</h3>
    <p>An inspirational, sculptural, presence at the heart of a city. You are attracted by its beguiling shapes. It welcomes you in. This building has a soul. You become aware of a community of people. People enjoying art classes, and educational facilities, with children in play areas.</p>
    <p>And just through those walls, you know is a beautiful hall — one of the great concert halls in the world, where the best artists, and the finest orchestras play.</p>
    <p>Imagine being embraced in the intimacy where performers connect with the audience, and you with them. The musical colours, the air with such a quality of sound as you have never experienced before. The magic of <a href="/building#acoustics">Yasuhisa Toyota, the master acoustician</a>.</p>
    <p>And Imagine that you could be witness to <a href="/building#architect">the legendary Frank Gehry</a> at work. That you could help give birth to this... that <a href="/donors">it could be you who can make possible this</a> last great cultural building by the world's greatest living architect. That it could be your philanthropic generosity that "gives soul to the universe, wings to the imagination, and life to everything".</p>

Frank Gehry's vision for a concert hall in Wimbledon will have a transformational effect not only on this area, but also on Londony's cultural life.

          <p>John Wilson: Frank Ghery, great to see you. Wonderful that you can join us from Los Angeles to give us this exclusive preview of your plans for the Wimbledon Concert Hall. Let's start with what I think it's an obvious loved concert hall. You created the Walt Disney concert hall in Los Angeles, 2003 I think and then, Berlin's Pierre Boulez Saal in 2016, the new World Center in Miami 2011, so it's great that Wimbledon will be joining that illustrios list. Why are you so drawn to concert halls first of all, Frank?</p>
          <p>Frank Ghery: My mother took me to, was in Toronto Canada, growing up. She used to take to Massey Hall and so, Ernest was the conductor. And I got to meet him. bycycle through the park and he was a very gentle and gregarious guy and so, I was a kid in the park. He stopped his bycicle to talk and I realised that he was the conductor. My family name when I was growing up was </p>
