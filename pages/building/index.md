## Acoustics: Yasuhisa Toyota

The Concert Hall will be an inspiring visual experience, a truly flexible 
space, with state-of-the art acoustics: with the benefits of the intimacy 
and sight-lines of the ‘vineyard’ design, within the warmer enveloping 
reverberations of the ‘shoebox’.

 “Playing in a great hall is a very special feeling. Acoustics are just so important”
Maxim Rysanov, violist
“That’s when those really inspiring, life affirming, memorable performances really 
happen when an artist is inspired by the space in which he is playing”       Ashley

“This collective experience in a great concert hall, a great performance of any kind, I
really believe elevates the soul”   Mike Fuller, Double Bass, Former CEO 
Philharmonia
“At its very best a visit to a musical performance is a multi-sensory, 
spatial, three-dimensional experience. It is influenced by the 
properties of surfaces, materials and light, interactions between 
performers, audience and each other, the way you move through 
foyers and up stairs and lifts. It extends to the streets around: the 
experience of a night of music includes getting there and leaving and 
eating and drinking in the neighbourhood.”      Norman Lebrecht
