“I love the challenge of concert halls.  
How do you make a building communicate?
How do you make the stage conducive to interaction
- or the orchestra share what the audience is feeling? 
It has to do with scale, materials, placement of details
its humanity”         Frank Gehry

“All were made possible by large-scale philanthropic gifts; all have 
become famous iconic works of architecture; and all are known by the 
name of the major philanthropic donor, or the business they 
represent.”        Billionaire Magazine
 “To have a Frank Gehry designed concert hall in Wimbledon would be a total 
transformation of London concert life. It would have a global effect. With these 
buildings the influence goes way beyond the art form.”             Esa-
Pekka Salonen
Having someone come to me with a concert hall project, my eyes light up.”
