## A Rich Cultural Hinterland

4 million people live within 30 minutes travel
A survey carried out by the Audience Agency indicated that 50% of the
concert hall’s audience would come from an 8 mile catchment area 
surrounding Wimbledon (identified in purple on the map below). Arts 
attendance by the population living within this catchment area is more
engaged than the London average with a significant audience 
attending classical music and theatres

Report conclusion: “The estimated catchment area around the 
proposed site for Wimbledon Concert Hall contains great potential in 
terms of audiences for classical music and a wider range of music 
genres, and support for such a venue. Combined with the potential 
within the large population of London the concert hall has a good 
sized market-place to draw on. If WCH decides to present a wider 
range of music genres it would greatly increase the potential 
audience.”
