The Vision: 

Music moves us, but too often these days, it just moves with us, little 
more than bits and bytes on a device. 
 
We offer an alternative: a unique opportunity to build an iconic, state 
of the art centre for live music. Frank Gehry’s vision for a concert hall 
in Wimbledon will have a transformational effect not only on this area, 
but also on London’s cultural life. His extraordinary new structure will
offer the highest quality musical experiences to everyone, from 
aficionados to local schoolchildren.
 
To see it happen, we need your help. We are looking for supporters 
who want to leave a lasting legacy for Wimbledon, Merton, London 
and the world of music.
