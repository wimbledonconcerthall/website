## Growing importance of the suburbs.

Society habits are changing.  People are working more and more from 
home, and reluctant to travel into the centre.  In many cities, Paris for 
example, the great concert halls have been established in the suburbs.
The 15 minute neighbourhood : and the 30 minute city:  
are ideas promoted by the Late Richard Rogers in which a community 
could be satisfied in its all its needs within a 15 minute cycle ride from
home - and by Arup considering the life contained within a travel 
distance of 30 minutes.
Renzo Piano, architect of the Shard, and many cultural projects has 
written: “We need to transform the peripheries (suburbs) and fertilise 
them with great public buildings such as universities, concert halls 
and libraries”

“Cultural centres give a special dimension to a great city, a city,  and I
don’t see why all the great cultural centres need to be in the middle of
a  great city, a metropolis like London.  If you have a beautiful concert
hall in a fantastic successful aspiring suburb like Wimbledon I would 
think it absolutely invaluable.”
