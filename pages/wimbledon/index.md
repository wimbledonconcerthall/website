A Gehry Concert Hall would transform Wimbledon and Merton into an important international cultural destination.

## Growing importance of the suburbs.

Society habits are changing. People are working more and more from home, and reluctant to travel to the centre. In many cities, Paris for example, great concert halls have been established in the suburbs.

The 15-minute neighbourhood and the 30-minute city are ideas promoted by the Late Richard Rogers in which a community could be satisfied in all its needs within a 15-minute cycle ride from home - and by Arup considering the life contained within a travel distance of 30 minutes.

Renzo Piano, architect of the Shard, and many cultural projects has written: “We need to transform the peripheries (suburbs) and fertilise them with great public buildings such as universities, concert halls and libraries”

“Cultural centres give a special dimension to a great city, a city,  and I don’t see why all the great cultural centres need to be in the middle of a great city, a metropolis like London.  If you have a beautiful concert hall in a fantastic successful aspiring suburb like Wimbledon I would think it absolutely invaluable.”

## A Rich Cultural Hinterland

**4 million people live within 30 minutes of travel**. A survey carried out by the Audience Agency indicated that 50% of the concert hall’s audience would come from an 8-mile catchment area surrounding Wimbledon (identified in the map below). Arts attendance by the population living within this catchment area is more engaged than the London average with a significant audience attending classical music and theatres.

Report conclusion: “The estimated catchment area around the proposed site for Wimbledon Concert Hall contains great potential in terms of audiences for classical music and a wider range of music genres, and support for such a venue. Combined with the potential within the large population of London the concert hall has a good sized market-place to draw on. If WCH decides to present a wider range of music genres it would greatly increase the potential audience.”
