green spaces and Common, reflected in Gehry’s design with its several
roof gardens.

## The cultural base

### Growing importance of the suburbs.

Society habits are changing.  People are working more and more from 
home, and reluctant to travel into the centre.  In many cities, Paris for 
example, the great concert halls have been established in the suburbs.
The 15 minute neighbourhood : and the 30 minute city:  
are ideas promoted by the Late Richard Rogers in which a community 
could be satisfied in its all its needs within a 15 minute cycle ride from
home - and by Arup considering the life contained within a travel 
distance of 30 minutes.
Renzo Piano, architect of the Shard, and many cultural projects has 
written: “We need to transform the peripheries (suburbs) and fertilise 
them with great public buildings such as universities, concert halls 
and libraries”
Video Robin O’Neill
“Cultural centres give a special dimension to a great city, a city,  and I
don’t see why all the great cultural centres need to be in the middle of
a  great city, a metropolis like London.  If you have a beautiful concert
hall in a fantastic successful aspiring suburb like Wimbledon I would 
think it absolutely invaluable.”

## Audience

### A Rich Cultural Hinterland

4 million people live within 30 minutes travel
A survey carried out by the Audience Agency indicated that 50% of the
concert hall’s audience would come from an 8 mile catchment area 
surrounding Wimbledon (identified in purple on the map below). Arts 
attendance by the population living within this catchment area is more
engaged than the London average with a significant audience 
attending classical music and theatres
8
Report conclusion: “The estimated catchment area around the 
proposed site for Wimbledon Concert Hall contains great potential in 
terms of audiences for classical music and a wider range of music 
genres, and support for such a venue. Combined with the potential 
within the large population of London the concert hall has a good 
sized market-place to draw on. If WCH decides to present a wider 
range of music genres it would greatly increase the potential 
audience.”
