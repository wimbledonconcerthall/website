“There’s a lotof stuff that happens around music that is exciting. It’s going to bring joy to the community, pride to the community. It’s part of the community” - Frank Gehry

Wimbledon and Merton currently present separate communities waiting for the opportunities presented the cultural hub to come together. The Trust will work closely in collaboration with Merton Music Foundation - an Arts Council Music Education hub - to bring striking opportunities to Merton school children

“It really works. The kids get involved. It’s not that they all grow up to become musicians, but it gives them confidence and it opens doors in their minds and gives them part of a bigger world. It’s just incredible what it does.”
