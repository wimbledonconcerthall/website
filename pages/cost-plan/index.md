Project costs - Headline figures

[based on independent budget by AECOM June 2022 - available on 
request]
• Total project cost £180-210m
• Construction costs £105m
• Procurement and Fit-Out £68m
[These figures incl:
• predicted inflation during 2 years design & planning, 3 years 
construction]
• 15% contingency throughout
The higher figure of £210m allows for increased inflation, and 
additional 10% contingency
The immediate call is funding of Frank Gehry design to 
Planning Consent.
• Design and Professional [RIBA Stages 2 & 3] fees: £9m
“I’m fastidious about budget control
‘Bilbao, the budget was $100 million and we came in a $97 million.  
Disney Hall was $207 million and we came in at $207-8 million’

“Here’s the game. Someone says, “Hey, guess what. We’re going to 
build a new concert hall and we just hired Frank Gehry!” Everyone 
starts saying, ‘You can’t do that, it’ll break the bank.’  I hear it all the 
time.  But it’s not true. A plain box building costs X, and a building 
with some humanity in it costs X plus 15%. But that’s everybody’s 
premium, not just Frank Gehry’s. It’s not an ego-driven premium. It’s 
a reality of making buildings with some sense of humanity.”  
Frank Gehry

I’d like to hurry and get it going.”
