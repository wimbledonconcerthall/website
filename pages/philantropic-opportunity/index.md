Global Philaanthropic, the Fundraising Team.

The Trust would like to encourage the financing of this project through
philanthropic gifts, and not to call on public funding. 
‘The Wimbledon Concert Hall project offers a rare opportunity 
for a philanthropist to make possible, and to be actively 
involved in, the creation of a major centre of international 
cultural  importance by one of the most celebrated architects of
our age.”  Ben Morton Wright
Global Philanthropic would be happy to arrange a meeting to discuss 
this with you.
