## Making it happen

We’re looking for supporters who want to leave a lasting legacy, and we need to move quickly. As Frank Gehry himself has told us, “I’m not sure how much more time I’ll have.” We need to secure the site and formally commission Frank and his team. The initial investment we need is about £9 million. Want to get involved? Please get in touch.

David Whelton: 

‘I’m standing in front of the Albert Memorial, a memorial to one of the great nineteenth century visionaries.  We are looking for a similar visionary today to help us realise our ambition for a new concert hall in Wimbledon”

Darcey Bussell:

And Wimbledon can offer the perfect site. There is a compelling vision of what is possible here.  We have Frank Gehry and his extraordinary team. We have a location and a brand. We just now need a visionary Patron to make it happen.

Frank Gehry:

We’ve got to do this.

John Wilson [interview]: ”For those people who are thinking of backing this project, Frank, seeing it built, what’s your message to them?”

Frank Gehry: ‘I’m very open and accessible”

Frank Gehry: “There’s a lot of opportunity to become part of it. I hope they will become involved with it, in the process of how we put this together. A trip to our office might be enlightening. I’ll be showing them what we’re doing, how we’re doing it.”

John Wilson: They are going to be getting one of the great concert halls of the world won’t they?

Frank Gehry: I hope it will be that. I will do my best.  My utmost best.

## Philantropic opportunity

[Global Philaanthropic](https://www.globalphilanthropic.com/), the Fundraising Team.

The Trust would like to encourage the financing of this project through philanthropic gifts, and not to call on public funding. 

‘The Wimbledon Concert Hall project offers a rare opportunity for a philanthropist to make possible, and to be actively involved in, the creation of a major centre of international cultural importance by one of the most celebrated architects of our age.”  Ben Morton Wright

Global Philanthropic would be happy to [arrange a meeting to discuss this with you](/contact).

## Cost plan

#### Project costs - Headline figures

[based on independent budget by AECOM June 2022 - available on request]
- Total project cost **£180 - 210m**
- Construction costs **£105m**
- Procurement and Fit-Out **£68m**

These figures include:

- Predicted inflation during 2 years design & planning, 3 years construction
- 15% contingency throughout

The higher figure of £210m allows for increased inflation, and additional 10% contingency

The immediate call is funding of Frank Gehry design to Planning Consent.

- Design and Professional [RIBA Stages 2 & 3] fees: £9m

“I’m fastidious about budget control ‘Bilbao, the budget was $100 million and we came in a $97 million.  
Disney Hall was $207 million and we came in at $207 - 8 million’ - Frank Gehry

“Here’s the game. Someone says, “Hey, guess what. We’re going to build a new concert hall and we just hired Frank Gehry!” Everyone starts saying, ‘You can’t do that, it’ll break the bank.’ I hear it all the time. But it’s not true. A plain box building costs X, and a building with some humanity in it costs X plus 15%. But that’s everybody’s premium, not just Frank Gehry’s. It’s not an ego-driven premium. It’s a reality of making buildings with some sense of humanity.” - Frank Gehry

#### Timeline

This is a 5-6 year project so project funding is on-going, and finance will be called on in smaller discrete packages during the different stages of development.

The initial design and site costs of £9m will be required during 5 quarterly period until Autumn 2023.

Other costs will be required as in the following table.
