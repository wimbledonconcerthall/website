## Project costs - Headline figures

*Based on independent budget by AECOM June 2022 - available on request*

- Total project cost **£180 - 210m**
- Construction costs **£105m**
- Procurement and Fit-Out **£68m**

These figures include:

- Predicted inflation during 2 years design & planning, 3 years construction
- 15% contingency throughout

The higher figure of £210m allows for increased inflation, and additional 10% contingency

The immediate call is funding of Frank Gehry design to Planning Consent.

- Design and Professional [RIBA Stages 2 & 3] fees: £9m

## "**I’m fastidious about budget control**. The budget for Bilbao was $100 million and we came in at $97 million. Disney Hall was $207 million and we came in at $207-8 million" - **Frank Gehry**

Here's the game. Someone says, “Hey, guess what. We’re going to build a new concert hall and we just hired Frank Gehry!” Everyone starts saying, ‘You can’t do that, it’ll break the bank.’ I hear it all the time. But it’s not true. A plain box building costs X, and a building with some humanity in it costs X plus 15%. But that’s everybody’s premium, not just Frank Gehry’s. It’s not an ego-driven premium. It’s a reality of making buildings with some sense of humanity.” - Frank Gehry
