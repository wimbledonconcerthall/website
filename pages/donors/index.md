## Project costs - Headline figures

*Based on independent budget by AECOM June 2022 - available on request*

- Total project cost **£180 - 210m**
- Construction costs **£105m**
- Procurement and Fit-Out **£68m**

These figures include:

- Predicted inflation during 2 years design & planning, 3 years construction
- 15% contingency throughout

The higher figure of £210m allows for increased inflation, and additional 10% contingency

The immediate call is funding of Frank Gehry design to Planning Consent.

- Design and Professional [RIBA Stages 2 & 3] fees: £9m
