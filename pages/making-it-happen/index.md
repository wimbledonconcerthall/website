title: "Making it happen"

We’re looking for supporters who want to leave a lasting legacy, and 
we need to move quickly. As Frank Gehry himself has told us, “I’m not 
sure how much more time I’ll have.”
We need to secure the site and formally commission Frank and his 
team. The initial investment we need is about £9 million. Want to get 
involved? Please get in touch.

David Whelton: 
‘I’m standing in front of the Albert Memorial, a memorial to one of the 
great nineteenth century visionaries.  We are looking for a similar 
visionary today to help us realise our ambition for a new concert hall 
in Wimbledon”
Darcey Bussell: 
 And Wimbledon can offer the perfect site.  There is a compelling 
vision of what is possible here.  We have Frank Gehry and his 
extraordinary team.  We have a location and a brand.  We just now 
need a visionary Patron to make it happen
Frank Gehry:
We’ve got to do this.

John Wilson [interview]:”For those people who are thinking of 
backing this project, Frank, seeing it built, what’s your message to 
them?”
 Frank Gehry: ‘I’m very open and accessible”
Frank Gehry: “There’s a lot of opportunity to become part of it. I 
hope they will become involved with it, in the process of how we put 
11
this together. A trip to our office might be enlightening. I’ll be 
showing them what we’re doing, how we’re doing it.”
John Wilson: They are going to be getting one of the great concert 
halls of the world won’t they?
Frank Gehry: I hope it will be that. I will do my best.  My utmost best.
